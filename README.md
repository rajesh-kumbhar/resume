This repository is a latex resume built on top of
[awesome-cv](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). and [Slyces/resume](https://github.com/Slyces/resume)

# Can I use this template?

Just like `awesome-cv`, you can write your own resume using this project.
However, unlike the former repository, this code is not currently as generic and
I can't guarantee that everything will automatically look good. I had to do many
small adjustments to get the rendering I was looking for, so I can't guarantee
you won't have to do the same.
